# Sonic_Sorter
A high-performance automated music organizer that scans audio files and sorts them into "Warm" (Analog/Organic) or "Cold" (Digital/Mechanical) directories based on metadata in V3 and V4. Future versions will overcome the limitation of poor metadata by directly analyzing the "sonic fingerprint" of tracks.
